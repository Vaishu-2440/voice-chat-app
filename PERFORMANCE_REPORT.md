### Moderate Network Conditions (50-200ms latency)
- **Total Response Time**: ~1.1s
- **Breakdown**:
  - STT: 200ms
  - API: 750ms
  - TTS: 150ms
- **Status**: ✅ Target met

### Poor Network Conditions (> 200ms latency)
- **Total Response Time**: ~1.3s
- **Breakdown**:

  - API: 950ms
  - TTS: 150ms
- **Status**: ⚠️ Slightly exceeds target

## Optimization Strategies

### 1. Caching Improvements
- **Service Worker**: Caches static files and API responses
- **Model Caching**: Whisper and TTS models cached locally
- **Response Caching**: Frequently requested responses cached

### 2. Parallel Processing
- **Web Workers**: STT and TTS run in separate threads
- **Non-blocking UI**: Main thread remains responsive
- **Background Processing**: Audio processing doesn't affect UI

### 3. Audio Optimization
- **Efficient Formats**: WebM with Opus codec for recording
- **Sample Rate**: 16kHz for optimal STT performance
- **Chunk Processing**: Real-time audio streaming

### 4. API Optimization
- **Token Limits**: Reduced max_tokens for faster responses
- **Temperature**: Optimized for speed vs creativity
- **Connection Pooling**: Reuse connections for faster requests

## Scalability Considerations

### Current Limitations
- **Model Size**: Whisper and TTS models require significant memory
- **Browser Support**: Web Workers and Audio APIs not available in all browsers
- **Network Dependency**: OpenAI API requires internet connection

### Future Improvements
- **Model Compression**: Smaller, optimized models
- **Progressive Loading**: Load models on-demand
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Offline-only mode with cached responses
- **Edge Computing**: Deploy models closer to users

## Monitoring and Metrics

### Real-time Monitoring
- **Performance Dashboard**: Live latency tracking
- **Color-coded Metrics**: Visual performance indicators
- **Historical Data**: Performance trends over time

### Key Metrics Tracked
